# Bikesharing

## Overview
In this challenge we use Tableau and data we gathered from the NYC Citi Bike Program to see if a similar bikesharing model would work in a city like Des Moine, Iowa. We analyzed that data to show different information such as starting/stopping times, duration, customer/substriber, and gender usage.

## Results
The following story from my [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/edin.cobaj/viz/Module_14_Challenge_16428134038280/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes) shows the result of our analysis.
- The first graph shows that most bike trips are relatively short, with the highest number of bikes being used for about 5 minutes.

- Chart 2 shows us that a vast number of users are male.

- This heatmap shows that typically, bikes are used heavily for work commutes and around mid-day on weekends.

- This chart shows that the usage times of bikes when comparing males and females are very similar.

- This chart shows us that a much higher number of users are subscribers instead of one-time customers as well as men being a much larger percentage of subsriber riders.

- In this comparison we can see that there is some change in concentration of bikes going from the city to the buroughs, this shows that there will be a need to transport bikes.
