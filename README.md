# Bikesharing

## Overview
In this challenge we use Tableau and data we gathered from the NYC Citi Bike Program to see if a similar bikesharing model would work in a city like Des Moine, Iowa. We analyzed that data to show different information such as starting/stopping times, duration, customer/substriber, and gender usage.
